# Sandwich Club Project

This project is the first test for the Android Nanodegree.

The project is based on the [started code](https://github.com/udacity/sandwich-club-starter-code) from Udacity.

Aside from the starter code, I also used the Apache Commons library v3.5 to join the lists like:

    ingredientsTv.setText(StringUtils.join(sandwich.getIngredients(), ", "));
